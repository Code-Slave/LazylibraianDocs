Very simple table, nothing to alter, just info.
The menu bar has five buttons <img src="https://imgur.com/kjO4GhT.png" width="400"><br>
**[Clear All History]** just wipes all history as you would expect. The next few buttons clear history of specific statuses. Note that "Failed" status is used to prevent downloading the same failed book again, eg if the download does not contain a book in the right format. If it failed because of a network issue or an api limit being reached it might be worth retrying, but usually LazyLibrarian can find another copy somewhere else. At the moment you cannot select individual rows to delete, though this might change in a later release. The "Clear Snatched" button can be useful to stop downloads that have been stalled, eg an incomplete torrent, though you can also choose to automate clearing failed/stalled downloads with a setting in config.

The final button is **[Download Count]** This displays a pop-up showing how many downloads were successfully processed from each provider. If all your downloads come from one or two providers, it might be worth dropping the others to save time and bandwidth. On the pop-up is a button to clear the totals if you want to start counting again.
