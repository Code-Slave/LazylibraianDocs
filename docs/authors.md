The table itself should be fairly self explanatory, follows the same layout and description as earlier pages. 
The menu bar has a lot more buttons though.<br><img src="https://imgur.com/SFyUsnx.png" width="700">

**[Refresh Author]** reloads the author details and booklist from Goodreads/GoogleBooks similar to the "Refresh Active Authors" option on the homepage, but it just does it for the one author, not the whole library.

**[eBook Scan]** and **[AudioBook Scan]** are similar to the options on the eBook and AudioBook pages, they run libraryscan, but only on the one author. 

**[Remove Author]** removes the author and all their books from the lazylibrarian database. It does not delete any book files, just the database entries. 

**[Pause Author]** and **[Resume Author]** are used to control whether the authors booklist should be updated periodically

**[Ignore Author]** stops the author appearing in lazylibrarian webpages. Useful if you have a book by them, but don't want any more

**[Ignored books]** shows books by this author marked as ignored. You might want to ignore books that have been incorrectly attributed to this author, or if the author has written a book or series you want, plus other books on unrelated subjects you aren't interested in and don't want to show in their author page.

To the right there may be one or two select boxes <img src="http://i.imgur.com/195Qod5.png" width="250">

**[Library]** switches between displaying the authors eBooks and AudioBooks and **[Language]** selects books tagged in different languages. Note that for AudioBooks this is goodreads/googlebooks idea of language, not the actual language of any audio files.

In the author details above the table there is a photo, the author name, and an **[Edit]** button. Clicking the author name takes you to their page on GoodReads. Clicking **[Edit]** takes you to a page where you can edit some of the author details, and upload a new author image.
